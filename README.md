# BrickBreakerGame-in-CS

##### Week 6 of Makers Academy was reading week. This was a chance to reflect on what we have previously learnt, and an oppourtunity to learn new technologies on our own.

I grasped at this opportunity to make a game and i thought a good place to 'start' was using the Unity 3D Engine that i downloaded through Unity's website and start trying to get my head around C#. 

### Technologies Used

- C#
- Unity 3D Engine
